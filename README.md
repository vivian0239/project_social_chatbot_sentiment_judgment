# project_social_chatbot_sentiment_judgment

In this project I build a simple chatbot Ella for “shopping mall assistant” usage scenario.
In Ella I add complaints dealing logic using gpt2 sentimental analysis fine-tuned model.
I tested the model and the precise is good(around 90%).

The python files I used:
*Main.py: agent
*Test.py: model testing
*dataPreprocess.py: data preprocess
*Finetuning.py: fine tuning model
*ShopAssistant.py: Ella

The data set I used for this project you can find in pptx file.
The logic of the training model and testing demo you can also find in pptx file.
